# Robo Dog
Bachelor thesis project which goal was to design Reinforcment learning algorithm for locomotion of quadruped robot. 

## Test

In order to test algoritm you have to have installed necessary toolboxes: 
- Reinforcment Learning Toolbox
- Simscape Multibody

if everything is installed simply run 
`run.m`.
It will download agent and run simulation.

All files used for design are in reset repository but those are not cleaned and describet yet.
